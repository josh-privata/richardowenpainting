                                        Painting is one of the least costly ways that can improve and change the overall
                                        appearance of your home. It protects your home from the ageing, gives it greater

                                        and increases it's value. It can make an older home look
                                        fresh and new again or make home stand out in the neighbourhood.

                                        pictures, photos,
                                        and wall hangings but nothing brightens up the room like a professionally

                                        An excellent paint job can mean elegance and beauty, but
                                        it also does so much more. Quality paint offers a barrier against the elements

                                        The first step is to clean out the area with an industrial vacuum, degrease,
                                        acid etch
                                        and then pressure clean to provide a clean surface for paint to adhere to.

                                        The next process is to apply two coats of the selected product and
                                        allow for plenty of drying time in between coats, a third or fourth coat may be
                                        added if
                                        required for extra protection in high traffic areas.
                                        A wait of approximately 7 days is necessary before heavy-duty walking traffic or
                                        driving on your new
                                        floor to ensure maximum curing and longevity.

                                        Is your roof faded, rusted & badly in need of a good quality paint job?
                                        Look no further than Richard Owen Painting.

                                        Did you know that your roof protects the internal timber structures of your home
                                        from harsh
                                        weather conditions? This is why it is important to keep it maintained through
                                        regular inspections,
                                        repairs and painting rather than to let it deteriorate.
                                        We can colour match your original roof colour or offer advice on a huge
                                        selection of colours and finishes.
